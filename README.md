# CapaCiTi-Sprint4-Intro-To-Python-
During my time at CapaCiTi, we were working on a LMS, where we would do a Sprint every week. The fourth sprint was a banking app where a user could deposit or withdraw an amount, this time it had an interface which was created by using TKinter. This was done using Python, which was learned from Introduction To Python.
